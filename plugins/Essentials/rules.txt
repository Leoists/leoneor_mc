1. Speak and behave in a family-friendly manner.

2. Have fun, be nice. If you upset someone, stop & apologize.

3. Transferring items from creative mode to survival mode
(same player or different players) is &n&ccheating&r unless you 
have explicit permission from Dadp00l.

# Rule_1
This is a family server, please speak and behave 
like your parents might be here (because some of
them actually are or will be).

# Rule_2
Be nice in words &nand&r actions. If somebody asks you 
to stop bothering them, say sorry and back off. If 
you made a bad decision, be honest about it-- what
happens on this server gets logged, and if you make
the op waste time searching through the logs to 
figure out what really happened, that will add or
increase the penalties.

# Rule_3
Transferring any object from a player in creative 
mode to a player in survival mode without Dadp00l's 
permission is cheating and may result in penalties 
for not only the cheater but also everyone who
failed to report them.
