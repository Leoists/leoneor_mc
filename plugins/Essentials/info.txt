The following are topics for which the &a/ifo&r command 
works. Just type &a/ifo <topic>&r for any of the below:
&aplaces, creative, survival, protected, villages,
&aicebridge, spawn, home, trade, chat, locks, colors, requests
&alegends

# places 
&lTo return to Castle Floatingpoint, type &a/warp spawn&r.
To return to your home, type &a/home&r. To teleport to 
another player, type &a/tpa <playername>&r and wait for 
them to accept your request (by typing the &a/tpaccept&r
command). To go back to where you were before you 
teleported (including the above methods) you can type
&a/back&r. From Castle Floatingpoint there is a door
opening directly to a creative region. There is 
also a loooong ice bridge going accross the sea to 
a survival region. See also &a/ifo home&r and 

# creative 
In creative regions you can build vast magnificent structures 
to your heart's content. Just one rule to keep it fair: &cyou 
&cmay not transfer items to players who are in survival mode 
&c(yourself or others)&r. When you enter a creative region your 
survival inventory disappears but it will come back when you 
leave. Mobs spawn but cannot harm creative players. There's a
creative region out the north iron doors on the bottom floor 
of Castle Floatingpoint. Just jump (or fly) off the edge.

# survival 
Most of the world that isn't protected or creative is regular 
survival with a few added commands. Some redstone devices
that don't work in creative might work here. Parts Green 
Island below Castle Floatingpoint are survival. There's also a
huge icebridge going from the ground floor of Castle
Floatingpoint to the northwest. If you find a place in survival
that you want to convert to creative so that you can build
something fun there, please read &a/ifo requests

# protected 
In protected regions you can use most gadgets (including 
chests) but you are prevented from breaking blocks, placing 
blocks, and attacking mobs. No hostile mobs spawn here. 
Castle Floatingpoint is protected and so are most of the 
villages near it. In your journeys you might find some 
tourist spots and those are also protected.

# villages 
The villages near Castle Floatingpoint are named Northville,
Northwestville, Southeastville, Southwestville, and Northeastville.
When a player finds one of them for the first time in the game, 
a warp point will be created for the village and a plaque in that
player's honor will be installed in that village square. There is
also Ground Zero, an ancient landmark someplace far, far away from
Castle Floatingpoint.

# icebridge
Icebridge is a loooong bridge made of ice stretching from
Castle Floatingpoint northwest across the sea and through a 
megataiga biome only to unceremoniously dead-end on a 
hillside. Or does it? Someday it may be a passenger rail 
line. But for now it's a convenient shortcut to get away 
from it all to a woodsy survival environment. No 
guard-rails yet, so be careful.

# spawn 
Spawn is located in Castle Floatingpoint which floats 
above Green Island. Anytime you type &a/warp spawn&r 
into the console, you will return here. Also, you go 
here after being killed if you don't have a working 
bed. Downstairs in the glowstone room there are
exits to a creative area (double metal doors) and a 
long icy bridge accross the sea to the survival 
wilderness. Welcome, have fun, and play nice. See also
&a/ifo places&r

# home 
You can claim a bed by right-clicking on it. After that,
when you get killed you will wake up in that bed and when
you type &a/home&r in the chat you will also go there. If 
your bed gets broken or otherwise unclaimed, you will start
appearing in Castle Floatingpoint when you die. We don't 
(yet) have regions you can claim as your own and keep 
everyone else out, but you can lock your chests and doors
by right-clicking them with a sign. See &a/help lockette&r
for more information.

# trade 
You start with a certain amount of money that you can use 
to pay in-game vending machines. You can also pay players 
for goods or services with the &a/pay <playername> <amount>&r
command. You can buy and sell things to some villagers 
using emeralds as money (the villagers at Castle 
Floatingpoint have an especially rich selection of 
merchandise).

# chat 
The main chat method is to just type stuff into the chat 
console. You could also use the &a/mail <player> <message>&r 
command to send a message to somebody not currently logged in 
or &a/mail&r to check your own messages. To contact an op 
(most likely Dadp00l) use the &a/helpop <message>&r command.

# locks 
To lock a door so that only you can open it, take a sign and 
right-click with it on the block right above the door. To lock 
a chest, take a sign and right-click with it on the chest while
sneaking. Remember to not be a jerk-- if you didn't build a 
door or chest you probably shouldn't be locking it. There are 
additional tricks to locking things (multiple people and
timeouts). To learn more about those, type &a/lockettepro&r

# requests
If you have a request or suggestion, please 
go to this link... https://github.com/bokov/leoneor_mc/issues/new/
...then fill it out and click 'Submit new issue'. You will need
to set up a GitHub account, but they are free. Before you request to
to convert someplace to creative (or back from creative to survival)
please hit the F3 key in-game at one corner of the area, write down
the X and Z coordinates, then go to the opposite (diagnoal corner) 
and write down those coordinates. In your creative/survival request
please include the coordinates of those corners, how far up and down
you want the proposed region to extend, and your reasons for wanting
it to be converted. You might be told to change certain things about
the area before the request is granted.
